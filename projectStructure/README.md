# PROJECT STRUCTURES
As a general rule of thumb, split your project into phases.
## PHASE 1: SPECIFICATION & DESIGN
Understand the requirements of your project. If this is a personal project, first sketch out WHAT your project wants to do. I prefer including the WHY I want to complete this project as well (for Resume? Hobby? Skill-Dev?)
Next, draft a ROUGH design doc. Think modularly. How will each module interact? Depending on the module's complexity, you may want to document the API.  
You need SOME amount of planning, but don't get bogged down documenting EVERYTHING. Like all good writing, your documentation depends on your audience. Your future self or teammates will thank you.
## PHASE 2: PROJECT SET-UP
Using your design doc, set-up:
0. Project Directory
1. Automated Build System
2. Automated Testing System
PROJECTNAME contains a very general project structure. Don't blindly use it for every single project. Spend a few minutes drafting a directory layout that makes sense for your specific project.
## PHASE 3: MODULAR DEVELOPMENT
* Develop in Modules
* Continually add tests when you come across issues verifying each module
* Document what you need to test. This is a good starting point for documenting your general API
* Document your REASONS for implementing code a certain way (WHY). Don't verbosely describe HOW each part of your code works

## PHASE 4: TESTING
* Think of edge cases, if you've been diligent in phase 3 you should have a solid starting suite to base off of
* Integration tests
